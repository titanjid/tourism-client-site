                <span className="fs-4">Traveller Maggie Brown reports</span>:  "I travelled from Dhaka to Srimongel in July 2011. I went up to Srimongel in a 2nd class carriage with reclining seats without air conditioning, but with the windows open and fans.  On the return journey we were in a first class cabin that seated 4 with seats that faced just one way with A/C.  Srimongel is north of Dhaka and famous for its tea plantations and 5 layered tea.  It's a popular weekend trip with the few tourists and also locals.  Both journeys were comfortable but the 2nd class journey was far more interesting as there was a constant stream of vendors coming up and down the aisle and you could look out of the window.  With the fans on and windows open it wasn't uncomfortably hot at all.  In the first class A/C cabin the windows were frosted and closed and there was nothing to look at except an empty wall. On both journeys the train was late (between 30 minutes and 90 minutes late). It took about 4 hours."

                <span className="fs-4">Traveller S.P Chattopadhyay reports</span>:  "I travelled via AC sleeper  on the overnight inter-city express, and trip was comfortable and uneventful.  Train arrived at platform in Chittagong "new" station about 45 minutes ahead of departure time of 11pm.  Compartment was clean, but the linens looked worn.  AC was working well and arrival into Dhaka was on time at 6:20 am.  I was able to buy the ticket the day before departure, without any problems. I would recommend this train over intercity bus travel between the two cities which involved traffic tie-ups and harrowing over-taking/lane-changing in face of unheeding opposing traffic!"
